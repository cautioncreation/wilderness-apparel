## Description
Wilderness-apparel Co. is a mock e-commerce store built using React and React-Bootstrap. I did not use code from any resources other than these two frameworks to develop the website. The websites features include a fully functional react-router navigation, a responsive contact form which simply needs to be connected to an output email to be used, A shop with filters for categories, stocked sizes and colours, as well as the ability to sort by featured items or price in either direction. Items can be added to the cart after you've selected the size and quantity. From the cart the quantity of each individual item can be changed, or the items can be deleted from the cart entirely.
